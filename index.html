        <h2>Writing Buddy</h2>
        <h3>2021</h3>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>UI/UX</li>
          <li>Branding</li>
          <li>AI</li>
          <li>Deep Learning</li>
          <li>Web Dev</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have dyslexia and as such, have always found writing and
          particularly spelling difficult and tedious. While there are a number
          of tools on the market designed to aid people with learning
          difficulties, based on my experience, all fall short in one way or
          another. To fix this I developed Writing Buddy, a “what you see is
          what you get” text editor designed to help people write better, faster
          and with more confidence.
        </p>
        <button
          class="collapse-btn btn"
          collapsed="true"
          onclick="this.setAttribute('collapsed', this.getAttribute('collapsed') === 'true'? 'false' : 'true')"
        >
          more...
        </button>

        <div class="collapse-body">
          <p>
            Writing Buddy is built on the principle that the best way to help
            people who struggle with writing and spelling is to reduce the
            amount of writing and spelling they actually have to do. I achieved
            this by developing a state of the art custom prediction engine that
            predicts the next word, dramatically decreasing the amount of words
            that need to be typed. This has the additional benefit of appealing
            to students and professionals who just want to express themselves
            faster than otherwise possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly every part and component of Writing Buddy is bespoke, with
            everything from the UI/UX and branding to the prediction engine
            designed and built by myself. The Writing Buddy editor is built in
            TypeScript and React and the prediction engine is built with a
            combination of deep learning and traditional computer science
            techniques.

        <h2>My Own Programming Language</h2>
        <h3>2021</h3>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Lexing & Tokenization</li>
          <li>Syntactic Analysis</li>
          <li>Parsing</li>
          <li>Compiler & Interpreter Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For a while now I have been fascinated by computer languages and when
          over the semester break, I had a bit of time on my hands, I decided
          to—as an academic exercise—design my own language. My language
          consists of two components; the recursive descent parser which first
          lexers and tokenizes the input before generating an abstract syntax
          tree (AST); and the interpreter which traverses the AST and produces
          the appropriate output.
        </p>
        <p>
          My language currently includes features such as closures, lambda
          expressions, first class and pure functions, making it well-suited to
          functional programming. In addition to this I plan to add support for
          multithreading and a stronger type system plus optimizations for
          tail-call recursion. I am also experimenting with implementing a stack
          based virtual machine—bytecode interpreter—to run my language.

        </ul>
        <p>
          As part of the university subject IT Project, I was required to
          produce an ePortfolio web app as part of a small group. We called our
          app Glowbal and built it with TypeScript, React, Express and employed
          an agile development process. I was a front end lead and wrote most of
          the UI components. I was also responsible for accessibility testing
          and ensuring users of all abilities could access our app.

        <p>
          For the subject Graphics and Interaction, I worked in a team to
          produce a time based endless runner game called CyberHeist. The game
          was built in Unity/C# and made use of a number of Azure APIs to add
          online play functionality. I was responsible for most of the online
          investigation and a large amount of the game logic, shader programming
          and user testing. CyberHeist received a final mark of over 95% and the
          trailer can be found below.

        <p>
          At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I
          completed a number of architecture and design electives. In one of my
          favourite architecture subjects we had to design and 3D print a
          pavilion using parametric tools and present it in VR with Unreal
          Engine. I programmatically modeled a magnetic field and extracted the
          field lines to inform the structure of my pavilion. I enjoyed this
          assignment so much I decided to extend myself and produce a number of
          3D ray traced renders some of which are below. My design received
          first class honors and was chosen to be exhibited in the prestigious
          Melbourne School of Design annual exhibition (MSDx).

          The below screenshot is of a university assignment, where we had to
          follow a spec and use object oriented design principles and patterns
          to produce a brick-breaker type game in Java. I finished with time to
          spare so decided to implement a real time lighting and particle engine
          from scratch. The engine was capable of handling different lights at
          different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number of
          shadow casting game objects.

          In my final year of high school I took a subject called Visual

          assignment to develop and fulfill a brief for a fictional client. I
          gave myself the brief to design a series of smart home appliances for
          the made up company Jackalope and produce accompanying visual identity
          and advertising material. Below is a poster of a smart speakers I
          designed with the Jackalope logo in the corner. See more of this

          technically challenging games I have created, it was an open world VR
          sandbox written in Unity, where you could interact, move, rotate and
          scale the objects in the world to build anything you wanted.

          Great Balls of Fire was a game I made when I was 13 years old and is
          one of the creations I am most proud of. It was an endless scroller
          where you played as the titular Ball of Fire, attempting to stay in
          the sky by jumping on air ships. It was published on the App Store and
          Play Store and remained there for a number of years (before I got
          tired of paying Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand
          downloads.

          When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was
          never very happy with the low resolution look of the game. I decided
          to remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file containing
          alternative looks or textures for the objects in the game. When I put
          my work online, after some refinement I received my first 1000
          downloads. Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the
          download link. My texture pack was downloaded over 50,000 times,
          earning me a few hundred dollars.

          Below is one of my earliest creations dating back to 2010. As a
          budding 10 year old web designer I needed a website to showcase my
          work and attract “clients”, so I made one! I called it EdSites and
          registered the domain name edsites.biz with my father’s credit card
          and got to work. All the HTML, CSS and even the JavaScript was written
          completely by hand by me. The website was such a success that it
          resulted in some clients albeit they were all my family members.

          This represents just a small selection of the projects I have worked
          on over the years. I have many more pieces of personal, university and
          design work.
