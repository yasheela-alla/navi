My name is Yasheela and I am an undergrad, majoring in electronic at VIIT. I have a passion for all things technology and design, from network engineering & Cyber Security to 3D graphics.

In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in education, history, economics and politics.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of projects I have developed over my ten plus years of coding experience.
